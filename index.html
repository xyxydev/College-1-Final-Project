			<h5>Why Have a Family Reunion?</h5>
			<p>Each family has its own mix of reasons for planning a reunion. It might be a just-because sort of thing, or it may be planned to coincide with a major family milestone, like a 50th wedding anniversary. Some families establish a routine of having a reunion every year, or every five years, to make sure that far-flung relatives don't drift apart from one another. Even in families that see each other often, having a dedicated day or weekend when the focus is all about togetherness is useful in helping relatives reconnect.
			<p>Another purpose of a family reunion is to give young kids a chance to meet and get to know their cousins, aunts, uncles and other relatives, and for anyone else who is new to the family – like new spouses – to meet the extended group. For older relatives or those in poor health, a big family gathering presents one last chance to see everyone. These gatherings are also a way for families to celebrate their shared heritage and culture, to exchange family stories and to honor the memories of any relatives who have passed away.</p><p>Those are big, meaningful reasons to have these events. But for some families, a reunion is just a great excuse to take a wonderful vacation with all your nearest and dearest relatives.</p>
